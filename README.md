# DogBreeds

**Libraries:**

I used the libraries sklearn, keras, numpy, glob, random, cv2, matplotlib, tqdm and PIL.

**Motivation:**

My motivation is that I personally love dogs but it is hard for me to remember all the different dog breeds out there. That is why it would be wonderful to have a script that identifies dog breeds for me. 

**Files:**

dog_app.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook I used to classify dog breeds.
The README.md is the file you are just looking at which describes the project.

**Results:**

In the end dog breed classification worked very well. With 133 different breeds, an accuracy of 1% is already better than guessing.
Thus an accuracy of about 80% is a very good result. This was reached using transfer learning.

**Acknowledgment:**

When I was working on this project the things learned in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program were extremely helpful.
Furthermore I made use of those sources that helped me solving the problems:
